	- hook it up to twitter --done
- update icon
- allow the user to click on the front page to edit options - done
- add test vars so we only need to update urls from one location

Idea
	- crowd sourcing?  -- how can we put that in our extension
	
	
- If no one has clicked on the three links and another one comes delete one that is visible.
- Allow the user to switch which twitter feed based on location - change extension name
- tweet from inside of the popup
